Description of Project 

 

JobDash is an integrated job searching and job posting solution. The functionalities are divided by the three possible roles as follows: 

Administrator: 

The administrator will have CRUD authority over users and job postings (in the cases of phishing, false posts) 

Employer: 

The employer will be able to post job openings, close job openings, view applicants and select applicants for a position. 

Job Applicant: 

A job applicant will have a dashboard that includes a calendar for important dates, they will be able to receive reminder emails prior to an interview, they will have a page with all their previous and pending job applications, the ability to favorite a job, and a search function for the jobs they have already applied to. 

They will also have a CV builder helper, which will generate a C.V. based on information they input, and tailor the C.V. to the job they are applying to. 

Finally, there will be a job search function which will give all the matches with a particular set of keywords, but also ideally scrape the job postings from Indeed and LinkedIn. 

 

Technologies Used 

Jobdash will be built on a React, Python, Django, MySql stack, with hosting done on PythonAnywhere and Database hosting on Azure.
